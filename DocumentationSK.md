## Steps 

#### Terraform:
There are a total of 3 different main.tf Terraform files. General knowledge of instance contents is essential for understanding what infrastructure each Terraform file is creating. The diagram below shows each main.tf file and what each is responsible for creating:

1. The first terraform main.tf file is utilized to create the Jenkins infrastructure which includes 2 EC2 instances. There is a user-data script on that first main.tf file that installs Jenkins on the first instance. When the second instance launched terraform was installed manually. Some pre-existing resources were used to create this infrastructure. Refer to main.tf in the Jenkins Infrastructure folder to see the usage of pre-existing VPC and subnets.

2. Using the terraform which is installed on the third instance, two additional main.tf files were created (main.tf 2 and main.tf 3). As seen in the diagram above, main.tf 2 created the infrastructure in the East region whereas, main.tf 3 created the infrastructure in the West region. Each of these main.tf files (2 & 3) both have a user-data script that is responsible for installing dependencies as well as creating the environment and launching the application within that environment.

#### Keypair configuration:
1. It's important to note that resources vary by region they are created in. This includes the creation of a key-pair. The infrastructure in both the East and West regions requires 1 key-pair each. This is essential since the key-pair must be specified in the instance resource blocks in the terraform files when creating the infrastructure.

_AT THIS POINT CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS SUCCESSFULLY CREATED_

#### RDS Database configuration:
Now an AWS RDS database can be configured. The purpose of it is so that the 4 SQLite databases on each application instance can connect to each other for shared data. 

1. Navigate to AWS to configure the RDS database. For this deployment, make sure to select MySQL for "Engine Options". Then use the free tier template, create a username and password, allow public access, and disable encryption. After the database is created a default Security Group is also created, so make sure to edit that default Security Group and add the inbound rule to open port 3306 to IPv4 (everyone)
